\title{Find clusters of consecutive posees}
\usage{
consecutivePoses(Sentence, Pose = "NNP")
}
\arguments{
\item{Sentence}{a GeoDeepDive output nlp output record}

\item{Pose}{a string}
}
\value{
A character matrix
}
\description{
Returns tuples of GeoDeepDive docid, sentid, and sets of consecutive parts of speech (i.e., poses).
}
\details{
This function will find groupings of parts of speech that occur consecutively within a sentence using the poses output of the StanfordCoreNLP. It primarily makes sense to look for clusters of proper nouns ("NNP") to extract entities with multi-word names (e.g., people, places, organizations). However, you can look for other types of pose as well. The format is a matrix of tuples of GeoDeepDive docid, sentid, and the cluster of poses.

\examples{

# Unlock the example dataset
nlp_output<-data(usgs_gdd)

# Extract all clusters of proper nouns across all documents
ProperNouns<-apply(usgs_gdd,1,consecutivePoses,"NNP")
# Collapse back into a character matrix
ProperMatrix<-do.call(rbind,ProperNouns)

# Extract all adjectives in a single sentence
Adjectives<-consecutivePoses(usgs_gdd[350,],"JJ")
